**Part (a):** The price recommendation task for Acme can be formulated as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. In this context:

- **Arms**: Each arm represents a specific pricing strategy for an Acme product in a particular country. The arms are the different combinations of products and prices that Acme can choose to sell in various countries.

- **Rounds**: Rounds correspond to the time intervals or periods in which Acme can update its pricing strategy. In each round, Acme decides on the prices to set for its products in different countries.

- **Rewards**: The rewards represent the profit generated by each pricing strategy (arm) in a round. The reward is a measure of how well a specific price for a product in a specific country performs in terms of profit. It takes into account factors like the number of units sold, manufacturing costs, and market demand.

The goal of the price recommendation system is to recommend pricing strategies (arms) in each round to maximize Acme's cumulative profit over time.

**Part (b):** The context vectors that could be used based on the data Acme might possess include:

1. **Country-specific Data**: Information about each country where Acme operates, such as the economic conditions, local competition, consumer preferences, and income levels. This data helps in understanding the unique characteristics of each market.

2. **Product-specific Data**: Details about each product, including its production cost, popularity, demand elasticity, and historical sales performance. This data helps in pricing each product optimally.

3. **Time-based Data**: Seasonal variations, holidays, and special events that might influence consumer behavior and purchasing patterns. This data helps in setting dynamic prices based on time-sensitive factors.

4. **Competitor Pricing**: Data on pricing strategies used by Acme's competitors for similar products. Understanding competitor pricing can help in competitive positioning.

5. **Consumer Feedback and Reviews**: Feedback and reviews from customers about Acme's products in different regions. This data provides insights into consumer sentiment and satisfaction.

6. **Historical Sales Data**: Past sales data, including quantities sold and revenues generated for each product in different countries. This data can reveal trends and seasonality.

**Part (c):** The assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) rewards per arm in the typical bandit problem may not be entirely appropriate in the case of pricing recommendations for Acme. This is because:

- **Dependency on Context**: The profit generated by a pricing strategy depends on various contextual factors, such as country-specific conditions, product characteristics, and time-based influences. These factors introduce dependencies among rewards for different arms.

- **Non-Stationarity**: The profitability of a pricing strategy can change over time due to shifts in market conditions, consumer preferences, and economic factors. This violates the stationarity assumption of i.i.d. rewards.

- **Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off**: The optimal pricing strategy may vary across different contexts, requiring exploration of various arms to adapt to changing conditions. This contrasts with the i.i.d. assumption, where arms have fixed reward distributions.

**Part (d):** If we consider using a non-contextual bandit, the design would change significantly. In a non-contextual bandit, the recommendations are made without considering the specific context (e.g., country, product, time). Prices are chosen based solely on their historical performance or some fixed policy.

Impact on Exploration and Convergence:
- **Exploration**: In a non-contextual bandit, exploration would be less targeted and adaptive. Prices may be explored uniformly across all contexts, which can result in suboptimal pricing decisions in varying market conditions.

- **Convergence**: Convergence to finding good prices may be slower in a non-contextual bandit because it doesn't leverage contextual information to adapt quickly to changing dynamics. Contextual bandits can converge faster by focusing exploration where it's most likely to yield improvements.

In conclusion, while non-contextual bandits simplify the problem, they may lead to suboptimal pricing decisions and slower convergence when compared to contextual bandits, which consider the rich context-specific information available to Acme. Contextual bandits are better suited to the dynamic and context-dependent nature of the price recommendation task.
