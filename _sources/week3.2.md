# Lecture 6. PAC Learning Theory

**Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning Theory**:

**Definition**:
PAC learning is a framework in computational learning theory that studies the feasibility of learning a concept from a given class of concepts, based on a set of training examples. A concept class is said to be PAC-learnable if, given a sufficiently large set of random samples, a learner can approximate the concept with high accuracy, with high probability.

**Key Ideas**:
1. **Probably**: Refers to the algorithm's ability to produce a hypothesis that is "probably" (i.e., with high probability) close to the true concept.
2. **Approximately**: Indicates that the algorithm's output is allowed to be "approximately" (i.e., within some error tolerance) correct.
3. **Efficiency**: A concept class is PAC-learnable if there exists an algorithm that can learn the class in polynomial time based on the size of the examples, the error tolerance, and the confidence parameter.

**Importance of PAC Learning Theory**:

1. **Foundation for Machine Learning Theory**: PAC learning provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the learnability of concepts, bridging computer science and statistics.
  
2. **Performance Guarantees**: It provides performance guarantees for learning algorithms under certain conditions, giving insights into how many samples are needed to learn a concept to a given degree of accuracy.
  
3. **Model Evaluation**: PAC theory allows for the comparison of different learning algorithms in a formal way, offering a basis for understanding their relative strengths and weaknesses.
  
4. **Generalization Bounds**: It provides bounds on the generalization error, helping to understand how well a learned model will perform on unseen data.
  
5. **Guidance for Algorithm Design**: The theoretical insights from PAC learning have inspired the design of new algorithms and models in machine learning.
  
6. **Distribution-free Assumptions**: PAC learning makes minimal assumptions about the distribution of the data, making it a robust framework for analyzing the learnability across various data distributions.

In summary, PAC learning theory is a foundational framework in machine learning that provides a rigorous understanding of the learnability of concepts. Its importance lies in offering performance guarantees, guiding algorithm design, and providing insights into the generalization capabilities of models.

**Lecture 6: PAC Learning Theory (COMP90051 Statistical Machine Learning)**

1. **Introduction**:
    - Focus on Excess Risk and its decomposition into Estimation vs. Approximation.
    - Introduction to the concept of Bayes risk, which represents the irreducible error.
    - Introduction to Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning.

2. **Generalisation and Model Complexity**:
    - Previous theories focused on asymptotic notions (consistency, efficiency).
    - The need for finite sample theory is emphasized.
    - Model complexity and its relation to test error is discussed.

3. **PAC Learning**:
    - This is the bedrock of ML theory in computer science.
    - In supervised binary classification, the goal is to learn a function that classifies data into one of two labels.
    - Test error is bounded in relation to the Bayes risk.

4. **Decomposed Risk**:
    - Risk is decomposed into:
        * Estimation Error (Good)
        * Approximation Error (Ugly)
        * Excess Risk (Bad)
    - The trade-off between simple models (may underfit) and complex models (may overfit) is discussed.

5. **Bayes Risk**:
    - Represents the best possible risk.
    - Depends on distribution and loss function.
    - Bayes classifier achieves the Bayes risk.

6. **Bounding True Risk**:
    - The concentration inequality is introduced to bound the risk.
    - Hoeffding’s inequality is presented, which bounds how far a mean is likely to be from an expectation.
    - This provides a bound on true risk based on empirical risk.

7. **Uniform Deviation Bounds**:
    - There's a need to uniformly cover the deviation over a family of functions.
    - This is crucial for analyzing risks of models learned from specific learners.
    - The goal is to bound the worst deviation over an entire function class.

8. **Finite Function Classes**:
    - The Union Bound concept is introduced.
    - A uniform deviation bound over any finite class or distribution is presented.

9. **Discussion**:
    - Hoeffding’s inequality and its implications are discussed.
    - The potential limitations of the union bound are presented.
    - The upcoming topic, VC theory, is hinted at.

10. **Summary**:
    - The lecture delves deep into PAC learning, emphasizing the importance of understanding risk, its decomposition, and the tools to bound them.
